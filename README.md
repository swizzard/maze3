# samazing - sam's amazing maze games!

## how

you need to have rust and cargo installed (use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)), then clone the repo and run `cargo run` in the root.

## what

pick one of three maze games:

- `basic`: plain, obvious, unadorned
- `hidden`: unvisited rooms are hidden so you have to explore
- `lantern`: `hidden` plus your view is limited

in all of them:

- you're this guy: ðŸ˜€
- you're trying to get to the goal: ðŸ¥…
- red doors are impassible
