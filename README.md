# samazing - sam's amazing maze games!

## how

you need to have rust and cargo installed (use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)), then clone the repo and run `cargo run` in the root.

## what

pick one of three maze games:

- `basic`: plain, obvious, unadorned
- `hidden`: unvisited rooms are hidden so you have to explore
- `lantern`: `hidden` plus your view is limited

in all of them:

- you're this guy: 😀
- you're trying to get to the goal: 🥅
- controls
  - `w`/`k`/↑ - move north
  - `s`/`j`/↓ - move south
  - `a`/`h`/← - move east
  - `d`/`l`/→ - move west
  - `q` - quit
- red doors are impassible
